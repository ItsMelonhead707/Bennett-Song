### Bennett-Song is a Raspberry Pi that creates a network that generates a static website with a song library.

## About this Project
It was intended to work at places without internet or a network! (e.g. the beach)
You connect your smartphone to the Bennett-Song Network 
and have a song library to play guitar and sing from.
